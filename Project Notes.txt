----- Project information and notes -----

Overview: To create a portfolio project for the codecademy-CS101 module, I need to create a basic terminal program. 
    I will make a version of the game Battleship that can be played in the command line using Python 3. 

Scope and constraints (basic):
-this will be a single player game that takes the input (cell the hit) from the player and return if there is a hit or miss on the opponent ships
-fixed player and opponent board configuration
-opponent attacks are randomized

Potential additional scope goals:
-generate opponent's board
-allow user to create their own board
-add intelligence to opponent attacks
